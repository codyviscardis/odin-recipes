<p>
    Homemade garlic knots just as good as those you'll get in restaurants. The 
    base for the knots is a simple dough made with Greek yogurt.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 ¾ cups self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 cup plain whole-milk Greek-style yogurt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>flaky sea salt, for garnish</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet 
        with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
    </li>

    <li>
        Step 2: Stir together flour and 1/4 teaspoon each garlic powder, salt, and 
        Italian seasoning in a bowl. Stir in yogurt until mixture forms a shaggy dough. 
        Transfer dough to a well-floured work surface. Knead until mostly smooth, 3 to 
        4 minutes. If needed, add additional flour 1 teaspoon at a time to keep dough 
        from being too sticky.

        Step 3: Shape dough into a ball; press down gently to form a disk. Divide dough 
        into 8 even wedges (a bench scraper is handy). Roll each wedge into a rope about 
        10 inches long. Tie into knots. Arrange knots about 2 inches apart on the 
        prepared baking sheet.

        Step 4: Bake until knots are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

        Step 5: Meanwhile, whisk together melted butter, oil, parsley, and remaining 
        1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Brush still-warm knots 
        with butter mixture and sprinkle with flaky salt. Cool 5 minutes before serving. 
        Store cooled knots in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 days.
