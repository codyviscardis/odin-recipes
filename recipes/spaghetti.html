<p>
    This baked spaghetti recipe is from my children's preschool. A fun combination of 
    pasta and pizza ingredients, it's always a hit with the kids.

<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti, broken into 2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>4 ounces pepperoni sausage, sliced</li>
</ul>

    <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 
        9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>
        Step 2: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in 
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
        8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.

        Step 3: Mix 1/2 cup mozzarella, milk, egg, salt, and garlic salt together in a 
        large bowl. Add drained spaghetti and mix until well combined. Spread mixture 
        into the prepared baking dish.
    </li>

        Step 4: Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and reduce 
        the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>

        Step 5: Spread spaghetti sauce over noodle mixture. Sprinkle with oregano and basil, 
        then top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella. Arrange pepperoni over cheese.
    </li>

    <li>Step 6: Return to the oven and bake until cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, about 30 
        minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.</li>
